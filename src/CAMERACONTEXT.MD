Camera Functionality for the Event App

Overview

When a user enters an event, they can access the camera tab within the app. This allows them to capture images and videos that will be automatically uploaded to the event's shared gallery.

User Flow

Entering the Event: The user navigates to an event screen where they can see various options, including a "Camera" tab.

Opening the Camera: When the user taps on the "Camera" tab, the app launches the device's camera.

Capturing Media:

The user can take a photo or record a video.

After capturing, a preview is shown with options to either accept or retake the media.

Uploading to the Event Gallery:

If the user accepts the media, it is automatically uploaded to Supabase storage under the respective event.

The gallery updates in real time, displaying the newly uploaded content.

Technical Implementation

React Native Expo: The app will use Expo's Camera module (expo-camera) for capturing images and videos.

Media Preview: A preview screen will allow users to confirm before uploading.

Supabase Storage: The app will store media files in Supabase Storage, linking them to the event.

Real-Time Updates: Supabase Realtime will ensure new uploads appear in the event gallery instantly.

Considerations

Permissions: The app must request camera and storage permissions from the user.

Compression: Videos and images should be optimized for upload speed and storage efficiency.

Error Handling: Ensure proper error messages if upload fails or permissions are denied.

Security: Implement access control so only event participants can upload/view media.

This setup ensures a smooth and seamless media-sharing experience for event attendees.
